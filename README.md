# Location reminder
It's a to-do app that reminds you where you need to do something, and when you will be close at this location the app will throw a notification to remind you about that.

This app was created as an exam of Udacity course, and here I have applied some skills like make an authentication system using firebase Auth beyond creating unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
